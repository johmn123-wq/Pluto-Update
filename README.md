# E-commerce Website

Developed a Customer-Seller interaction e-commerce website which loads products a MongoDB databse and displays them. 
Users can select to display products in multiple categories and brands. User can also search products and select items
to purchase and  add them to their shopping cart and after successful transaction the confirmation email will be sent to 
the user.

I've Implemented backend part and features like user Authentication, search products by catagory or brands, invoice generation, 
checking order history, sending confirmation email after payment etc.

## Import Data
I have included a data folder in this repo. Inside that folder will be 2 folders called cart and item. These 2 folders contain a mongodump of the 2 collections that I use in this ecommerce demo. You can use the [import-data.sh](data/import-data.sh) script to import these 2 dumps to an ecommerce database, then you will have the same content that I have for this demo.

## Live Demonstration

The E-commerce demo can be [viewed online here](http://pluto-update.epizy.com/Pluto-Update-master/index.html).
